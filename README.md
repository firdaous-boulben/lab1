# Lab 1

## Objective
The main objective of this lab is to become familiar with the PyTorch library by applying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures to handle classification and regression tasks. The lab is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Regression
- Dataset: [NYSE Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse)
- Task: Predict stock prices based on numerical features such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.
- Objective: Apply regression using a Deep Neural Network to model the relationships between the features and the target variable.

### Part 2: Multi-Class Classification
- Dataset: [Predictive Maintenance Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)
- Task: Predict failure modes of industrial equipment based on multiple sensor readings.
- Objective: Build a multi-class classification model using a Deep Neural Network to predict failure types.

## Brief Synthesis of Learnings
Throughout this lab, I learned how to apply DNN models for both regression and classification tasks using PyTorch. Key takeaways include:

1. **Regression:** I learned to optimize hyperparameters using GridSearch, visualize training dynamics, and apply regularization techniques to improve model performance.
2. **Classification:** I gained experience in data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluating multi-class models using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

This lab provided a comprehensive understanding of deep learning workflows, from data preparation to model evaluation and optimization.
